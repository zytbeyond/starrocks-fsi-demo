# StarRocks Demo Storyline for Financial Services Industry (FSI)

## Business Scenario: GlobalBank - Real-time Financial Analytics Platform

### Company Background

**GlobalBank** is a multinational financial institution with operations in 30+ countries, serving over 50 million customers across retail, commercial, and investment banking. Founded in 1975, they've been undergoing a digital transformation initiative since 2022, with a focus on modernizing their analytics infrastructure. They currently use a mix of traditional data warehouses (Teradata, Oracle) and newer cloud solutions (Snowflake, AWS) but are facing significant challenges with real-time analytics, regulatory compliance, and cost optimization.

### Key Stakeholders

- **Jennifer Wei, Chief Data Officer**: Leading the digital transformation initiative, concerned about data silos and the ability to provide real-time insights
- **Michael Rodriguez, Head of Risk Management**: Needs faster risk assessment capabilities to meet regulatory requirements and improve decision-making
- **Sophia Chen, Head of Fraud Detection**: Requires real-time transaction monitoring and pattern recognition to prevent fraud
- **Robert Johnson, CFO**: Focused on reducing infrastructure costs while improving analytical capabilities
- **Aisha Patel, Head of Customer Analytics**: Wants to leverage customer data for personalized offerings and improved customer experience

### Current Challenges

1. **Real-time Risk Assessment Gap**:
   - Basel III and FRTB regulations require intraday risk calculations
   - Current batch processing creates a 4-hour delay in risk metrics
   - Market volatility requires immediate risk assessment for trading decisions

2. **Fraud Detection Latency**:
   - Transaction fraud detection systems operate with a 15-minute delay
   - Each minute of delay costs approximately $100,000 in fraud losses
   - Current systems struggle with the volume of real-time transaction data

3. **Customer 360 Performance Issues**:
   - Customer profiles span 20+ systems and data sources
   - Queries across these sources are slow and resource-intensive
   - Relationship managers can't access comprehensive customer information during interactions

4. **Regulatory Reporting Complexity**:
   - Compliance reports (BCBS 239, Dodd-Frank, MiFID II) require data from multiple sources
   - Report generation takes 2-3 days, limiting time for analysis and remediation
   - Data lineage and auditability are difficult to maintain

5. **Historical Data Access Challenges**:
   - 7+ years of transaction data must be retained for compliance
   - Historical data queries are too slow for interactive analysis
   - Moving data between storage tiers is costly and time-consuming

## Demo Narrative Flow

### Part 1: The Real-time Risk Management Challenge

**Scene**: GlobalBank's daily risk committee meeting

> "The market volatility has increased significantly in the last hour, but our risk dashboards are still showing this morning's metrics," says Michael Rodriguez. "We need to make trading decisions now, not four hours from now!"

The data team explains that their current architecture requires batch processing of risk calculations, creating significant delays in risk assessment.

**Demo Solution**: Show how StarRocks' Primary Key tables with Delete+Insert strategy provide real-time risk metrics with high query performance.

1. Create the market_data and position tables with Primary Keys
2. Insert initial market and position data
3. Show the current Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculation
4. Simulate market volatility with real-time updates
5. Demonstrate how quickly the risk metrics reflect the changes

### Part 2: The Fraud Detection Optimization Challenge

**Scene**: GlobalBank's fraud operations center

> "We just identified a new fraud pattern, but it will take days to implement it in our detection systems," sighs Sophia. "By then, we'll have lost millions."

The team discusses how their current fraud detection system requires manual optimization and can't adapt quickly to new fraud patterns.

**Demo Solution**: Demonstrate StarRocks' AutoMV with Tunespace that provides automatic optimization for fraud detection queries.

1. Create a Tunespace for fraud detection
2. Add complex fraud detection patterns to the Tunespace
3. Show the materialized view recommendations
4. Create the recommended materialized view
5. Demonstrate the query performance improvement and reduced detection latency

**Extended Discussion**: Address common questions about AutoMV for fraud detection

> "How does this compare to our current rules engine approach?" asks a fraud analyst.

Sophia explains the advantages of the AutoMV approach:

"Our current rules engine requires us to define specific patterns in advance. With StarRocks' AutoMV, we can run exploratory queries on transaction data, identify patterns, and have the system automatically optimize for those patterns. Let me show you an example..."

*[Show three related fraud detection queries: unusual transaction amounts, geographic anomalies, and velocity checks]*

"Instead of creating separate optimizations for each pattern, the AutoMV system recommends a single view that can accelerate all three detection methods. It pre-aggregates transaction statistics by account, location, and time period, making all our detection queries faster."

### Part 3: The Customer 360 Challenge

**Scene**: GlobalBank's customer experience strategy meeting

> "Our relationship managers need a complete view of customer relationships during interactions, but our current system takes 30+ seconds to load the data," explains Aisha. "By then, the customer is frustrated or the opportunity is lost."

The team discusses how their customer data is spread across multiple systems, making it difficult to provide a unified view quickly.

**Demo Solution**: Show StarRocks' dual materialized view approach with both synchronous and asynchronous materialized views for customer analytics.

1. Create synchronous materialized views for core customer information
2. Create asynchronous materialized views for complex relationship analytics
3. Demonstrate how synchronous MVs provide real-time customer profiles
4. Show how asynchronous MVs handle complex relationship analytics across multiple data sources

### Part 4: The Regulatory Reporting Challenge

**Scene**: GlobalBank's compliance department, two days before a regulatory deadline

> "We're still waiting for the BCBS 239 reports to finish processing," says the Compliance Officer. "If we find issues, we'll have no time to fix them before the submission deadline."

The team discusses how their current reporting process is slow and inflexible, making it difficult to meet regulatory requirements.

**Demo Solution**: Demonstrate StarRocks' superior performance for complex regulatory queries across multiple data sources.

1. Create tables for transaction data, risk exposures, and counterparty information
2. Show a complex regulatory query that joins multiple tables
3. Demonstrate the query performance with and without StarRocks optimizations
4. Show how reports that previously took hours now complete in minutes

### Part 5: The Advanced Analytics Challenge

**Scene**: GlobalBank's audit preparation meeting

> "The regulators want transaction details from three years ago for specific counterparties," says Robert. "Our archival system will take days to retrieve that data, and analyzing the patterns will take even longer."

The team discusses how their current data tiering strategy makes historical data difficult to access quickly, and their analytics tools struggle with complex pattern recognition.

**Demo Solution**: Demonstrate StarRocks' advanced analytics capabilities with materialized views.

1. Create a comprehensive historical transaction table with partitioning for efficient access
2. Set up materialized views that pre-compute common audit patterns
3. Show how complex pattern recognition queries execute in seconds instead of hours
4. Demonstrate how these views can be refreshed on a schedule to maintain accuracy

### Part 6: The Unified Analytics Vision

**Scene**: GlobalBank's executive strategy session

> "We're spending hundreds of millions on our data infrastructure, but still can't get the insights we need when we need them," says Jennifer. "We need a more unified approach that's both cost-effective and powerful."

The team discusses how their current architecture requires multiple specialized systems working together, creating operational complexity and increasing costs.

**Demo Solution**: Show how StarRocks provides a unified analytics platform that combines capabilities that would require multiple specialized systems.

1. Create a comprehensive dashboard that combines:
   - Primary Key tables for real-time market and transaction data
   - Synchronous MVs for customer profiles
   - Asynchronous MVs for relationship analytics
   - Advanced analytics for historical data analysis
2. Demonstrate how this unified approach simplifies the architecture and reduces costs

## Conclusion and Business Impact

**Scene**: GlobalBank's quarterly review meeting, three months later

> "Since implementing StarRocks, our risk metrics are now truly real-time, fraud detection latency has decreased by 90%, and we've reduced our data infrastructure costs by 35%," reports Jennifer.
